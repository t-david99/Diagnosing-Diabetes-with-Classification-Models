# Diagnosing Diabetes with Classification Models

## Description

In this project, I analyze the diabetes.csv dataset to answer the following questions:

1. Is a patient's glucose data enough to classify them as a diagnosed diabetic?

2. If more predictors than just glucose levels are required, are there any that are unnecessary for classification?

3. Which type of classification model best predicts whether a patient has diabetes?

## Directory Structure

This repository contains 3 files: Diabetes_Project.ipynb, diabetes.csv, requirements.txt, and README.md.

 - Diabetes_Project.ipynb contains all of my Python code and analysis of the diabetes data.

 - diabetes.csv is the dataset used for this project.

 - requirements.txt contains all required libraries to execute this project.

## Tools

The Python programming language was used to build this project, with Visual Studio Code as the preferred IDE.

## Setup

### Requirements

Inside the top level of the directory, enter:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Execution

1. Copy the diabetes.csv file path and paste it into the 2nd code cell. Specifically into the line `df = pd.read_csv()`.

2. Use your favorite IDE to run the Diabetes_Project.ipynb file.
